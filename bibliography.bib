	n2 = {Two-dimensional Anderson Transitions have inspired study since the 1950s, but much about their critical properties remains unknown. I examine multifractality, the appearance of fractal dimensions which are not linearly related in the level sets of a probability density function, in the context of the wavefunction of a system undergoing an Anderson Transition. In Part II, I explore the multifractality of a system under strong magnetic field and its dependence on disorder on the underlying randomness in the placement of impurities in the sample. I relate this to field theoretic methods used to study matter fields existing on curved manifolds. In Part III, I explore the general problem of finding fields that are scale-invariant under the renormalization group in a broad set of Anderson Transitions described by non-linear sigma models. I use a method for decomposing the function spaces on these models&apos; target spaces to find these entirely algebraically.},
