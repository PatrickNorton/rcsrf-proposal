* WAIT Abstract

* Background
+ Define/describe a Lie algebra

  A Lie algebra is a vector space equipped with $[,]$ that is:
  1. bilinear: $[x + \alpha y, z] = [x, z] + \alpha[y, z]$ (sim. in 2nd coord.)
  2. skew symmetric: $[x, y] = -[y, x]$
  3. Jacobi:
     \begin{equation*}
       [x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = 0.
     \end{equation*}

+ Explain Cartan

  The Cartan subalgebra is the bit of a Lie algebra that acts like diagonal
  matrices.

+ Explain weight vectors

  A weight vector is an eigenvector for every element of $\mathfrak{h}$.

  A /highest/ weight vector is a weight vector in the kernel of every action of
  $\mathfrak{n}^{+}$.

+ Describe highest weight modules

  A HWM is a module generated by a HWV.

+ Talk about combinatorics

* Rationale
+ Physics stuff
+ Structure of a Lie module is completely controlled by HWVs

* Aim/hypothesis
+ Classify all HW vectors
  + What weights are /highest/ weights?
  + Given a highest weight, what other weights appear?
  + How big are the corresponding modules, and what is their structure (how does
    $\mathfrak{g}$ act)?
  + Is there a nice description for how other nice modules decompose (e.g.
    $\text{Sym}(\mathfrak{g})$, or $L(\mu) \otimes L(\lambda)$)?
+ Do we have a specific hypothesis?

* TODO Design & procedure

* TODO My role

* TODO Sources
+ [cite:@Erd06]
+ [cite:@Ful91]
+ [cite:@Jos00]

* TODO Questions for research
+ [ ] How technical should the proposal be (besides the abstract)?
+ [ ] Do we have a specific hypothesis, or just a bunch of questions?
