\begin{abstract}
  % TODO
  This project is an attempt to classify the structure of certain mathematical
  objects. % TODO: Explain what mathematical objects
  The structure of these objects relates to important questions in both
  physics and mathematics. % TODO: What questions?
  We know that the structure of Lie algebras is completely controlled by
  specific elements, known as highest weight vectors. Our goal is to find all
  these highest weight vectors and determine how they relate to each other.
  % TODO: Prior art
\end{abstract}

\section{Background and Rationale}

% TODO:
% Lie algebra
% Cartan subalgebra
% Weight vectors
% Highest weight vectors
% Modules & highest weight modules
% All that physics stuff

\section{Specific Aim and Hypothesis}

% TODO:
% Explain what "classify" means

\section{Design and Procedure}

\section{Predicted and Alternative Outcomes}

\section{Role of Student}

The role of the students in this project will be to do computations, create examples, and prove theorems in order to build up to a classification of the highest weight vectors in $\Sym(\fg)$. The students will work together to produce (publish?) a paper (I assume this is the right word?) highlighting either a discovered classification, or any progress made towards such a result.

\section{Role of Faculty}

Zajj Daugherty and Noah Charles will (meetings of set frequency with research group?) be resources for the group and provide insight on good ways to proceed. % I have no clue what should actually go in this section

\section{Benefit to Student}

% TODO: Written by Zajj
