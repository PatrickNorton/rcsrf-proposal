  % TODO
  This project is an attempt to classify the structure of certain mathematical
  objects. % TODO: Explain what mathematical objects
  The structure of these objects relates to important questions in both
  physics and mathematics. % TODO: What questions?
  We know that the structure of Lie algebras is completely controlled by
  specific elements, known as highest weight vectors. Our goal is to find all
  these highest weight vectors and determine how they relate to each other.
